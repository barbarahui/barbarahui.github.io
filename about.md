I live in Oakland, California, where I work as a software developer in the [Access and Publishing Group](http://www.cdlib.org/services/access_publishing/) at the [California Digital Library](http://www.cdlib.org).

I completed my PhD in [Comparative Literature at UCLA](http://www.cdlib.org) in 2010, where I wrote a dissertation entitled _Narrative Networks: Mapping Literature at the Turn of the 21st Century_ under the advisement of N. Katherine Hayles and Todd Presner.

My work is featured in the film [Patience (After Sebald)](http://www.artevents.info/projects/current/the-re-enchantment/patience-after-sebald), directed by [Grant Gee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Gee).
